/**
 * Groups together the blob handles allocated for a single task submission.
 * <p>
 * A {@code BlobHandlesAllocation} bundles all blob identifiers required during the submission process:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the payload handle, which will hold the serialized manifest of inputs and outputs,</li>
 *   <li>the output handles, mapped by output name, which represent the results to be produced by the task,</li>
 *   <li>the input handles, mapped by input name, which are allocated for inline input values that must be uploaded.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This record is typically created by {@link BlobService#allocateBlobHandles} and consumed by
 * {@code ArmoniKClient} during task submission to orchestrate input uploads, payload construction, and task creation.
 *  @param payloadHandle      the handle reserved for the payload manifest blob
 *  @param inputHandlesByName  mapping from inline input names to their allocated blob handles
 *  @param outputHandlesByName mapping from output names to their allocated blob handles

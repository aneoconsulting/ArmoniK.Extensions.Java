/**
 * Service for monitoring blob completion events within an ArmoniK session.
 * <p>
 * The {@code BlobCompletionEventWatcher} provides asynchronous notification capabilities for tracking
 * when blobs (particularly task outputs) reach terminal states in the ArmoniK cluster. This service
 * establishes a server-side streaming connection to the ArmoniK Control Plane to receive real-time
 * events about blob state changes.
 *
 * <h2>Event-Driven Workflow</h2>
 * <p>
 * In the ArmoniK distributed computing model, tasks produce outputs that become available asynchronously
 * as workers complete their execution. Rather than polling for completion status, this watcher enables
 * reactive programming patterns by streaming completion events directly from the server.
 *
 * <h2>Blob States and Events</h2>
 * <p>
 * Blobs can transition through various states during task execution:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>PENDING:</strong> Blob declared but not yet produced</li>
 *   <li><strong>COMPLETED:</strong> Blob successfully created and available for download</li>
 *   <li><strong>ABORTED:</strong> Blob creation failed due to task failure or cancellation</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Patterns</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Watch for task output completion
 * BlobCompletionEventWatcher watcher = services.blobCompletionEventWatcher();
 *
 * List<BlobHandle> outputHandles = Arrays.asList(taskHandle.outputs().values());
 *
 * CompletionStage<Void> watchResult = watcher.watch(
 *     sessionHandle,
 *     outputHandles,
 *     new BlobCompletionListener() {
 *         @Override
 *         public void onBlobCompleted(Blob blob) {
 *             // Download and process completed output
 *             System.out.println("Output ready: " + blob.metadata.id());
 *         }
 *
 *         @Override
 *         public void onBlobFailed(Blob blob, Throwable error) {
 *             // Handle failed output
 *             System.err.println("Output failed: " + blob.metadata.id());
 *         }
 *     }
 * );
 *
 * // The future completes when all watched blobs are terminal
 * watchResult.thenRun(() -> System.out.println("All outputs completed or failed"));
 * }</pre>

   * Starts watching the specified blob handles for completion events within the given session.

   * for different blobs may arrive in any order depending on task execution timing. The listener
   * callbacks are invoked asynchronously and should handle concurrent access appropriately.

/**
 * Callback interface for receiving asynchronous notifications about blob completion events.
 * <p>
 * The {@code BlobCompletionListener} provides a reactive programming model for handling blob
 * state changes within the ArmoniK distributed computing platform. This interface is primarily
 * used to receive notifications when task outputs become available for download or when blob
 * operations fail.
 *
 * <h2>Event-Driven Task Processing</h2>
 * <p>
 * In ArmoniK's asynchronous execution model, tasks run on remote workers and produce outputs
 * at unpredictable times. Rather than polling for completion, applications can register a
 * {@code BlobCompletionListener} to receive immediate notifications when:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Task outputs are successfully created and available for download</li>
 *   <li>Task execution fails, causing expected outputs to become unavailable</li>
 *   <li>Network or storage issues prevent blob operations from completing</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface must be thread-safe, as callback methods may be invoked
 * concurrently from multiple threads within the ArmoniK client's event processing system.
 * The callbacks are typically invoked on gRPC event loop threads or executor service threads,
 * not on the calling application's main thread.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
 * <p>
 * Implementations should handle exceptions gracefully within callback methods. Uncaught
 * exceptions thrown from callback methods are logged but do not interrupt the event stream
 * or affect the processing of other events. However, they may prevent proper resource
 * cleanup or error reporting for the specific event that triggered the exception.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
 * <p>
 * Callback methods should complete quickly to avoid blocking the event processing pipeline.
 * For CPU-intensive or I/O-bound operations, consider offloading work to a separate thread
 * or executor service:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * private final Executor processingExecutor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
 *
 * @Override
 * public void onBlobCompleted(Blob blob) {
 *     processingExecutor.execute(() -> {
 *         // Perform heavy processing off the event thread
 *         processLargeResult(blob.data());
 *     });
 * }
 * }</pre>

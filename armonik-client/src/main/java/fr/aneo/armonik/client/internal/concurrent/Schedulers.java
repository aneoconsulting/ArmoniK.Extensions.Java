/**
 * Utility class providing shared scheduled executor services for the ArmoniK client.
 * <p>
 * This class manages a singleton {@link ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} instance that is used
 * throughout the ArmoniK client for scheduling delayed operations, timers, and periodic tasks.
 * The shared executor is optimized for the client's batching and coordination needs.
 * <p>
 * The shared scheduler is configured with:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Single thread:</strong> Uses one daemon thread to minimize resource overhead</li>
 *   <li><strong>Daemon thread:</strong> Won't prevent JVM shutdown</li>
 *   <li><strong>Optimized cleanup:</strong> Removes canceled tasks immediately to prevent memory leaks</li>
 *   <li><strong>Shutdown behavior:</strong> Doesn't execute delayed tasks after shutdown</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A JVM shutdown hook is automatically registered to properly shut down the executor when
 * the application terminates, ensuring clean resource cleanup.
 *

   * This method provides access to the singleton {@link ScheduledExecutorService} instance

   * <ul>
   *   <li><strong>Thread-safe:</strong> Can be safely accessed from multiple threads</li>

   * <strong>Usage Guidelines:</strong>
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Do not call {@code shutdown()} on the returned executor</li>
   *   <li>Prefer this over creating new schedulers for better resource utilization</li>
   *   <li>Use {@code schedule()} methods for delayed operations</li>
   *   <li>Use {@code scheduleWithFixedDelay()} for periodic operations with cleanup needs</li>

 * Basic batching utility for managing multiple blob completion watching operations.

 * operations through a single {@link BlobCompletionEventWatcher} instance. It allows
 * enqueueing multiple watch requests and waiting for their collective completion.
 *

 * <strong>Note:</strong> This is a basic implementation that will be fully reworked in
 * future versions. The current design is intended for simple use cases and may not be
 * suitable for high-throughput or complex batching scenarios.

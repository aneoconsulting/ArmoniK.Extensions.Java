/**
 * Callback interface for receiving asynchronous notifications about blob completion events.
 * <p>
 * The {@code BlobCompletionListener} provides a reactive programming model for handling blob
 * state changes within the ArmoniK distributed computing platform. This interface is primarily
 * used to receive notifications when task outputs become available or when blob operations fail.
 * <p>
 * The listener is registered when defining a session, allowing applications to specify how
 * they want to handle completion events for all task outputs within that session context.
 * <p>
 * In ArmoniK's asynchronous execution model, tasks run on remote workers and produce outputs
 * at unpredictable times. Rather than polling for completion, applications can register a
 * {@code BlobCompletionListener} to receive immediate notifications when outputs are ready.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface must be thread-safe, as callback methods may be invoked
 * concurrently from multiple threads within the ArmoniK client's event processing system.
 *
 * @see BlobCompletionEventWatcher
 * @see BlobCompletionCoordinator
 * @see SessionHandle#awaitOutputsProcessed()

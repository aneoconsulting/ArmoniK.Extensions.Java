/**
 * Handle representing a submitted task within the ArmoniK distributed computing platform.
 * <p>
 * A task in ArmoniK is a unit of work launched by a client and processed by a worker [[1]](https://armonik.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/armonik/glossary.html).
 * Tasks cannot communicate with each other directly, but can depend on each other through their inputs and outputs.
 * This handle provides access to task metadata, configuration, and associated blob handles for inputs and outputs.
 * <p>
 * TaskHandle instances are immutable references that:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Provide access to the session context where the task was submitted</li>
 *   <li>Hold references to input and output blob handles</li>
 *   <li>Expose task configuration and metadata asynchronously</li>
 *   <li>Support non-blocking access to task information</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The handle itself does not perform blocking operations. Task information and blob operations
 * are accessed through completion stages and blob handles, respectively.

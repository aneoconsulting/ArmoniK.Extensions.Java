/**
 * Strategy for serializing task input/output blob identifier mappings into payload manifests.
 * <p>
 * A payload manifest is a compact representation of all blob identifiers associated with a task,
 * including both inputs and expected outputs. The ArmoniK runtime uses this manifest to resolve
 * blob references during task execution.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface define the format and encoding used for the payload manifest.
 * The default implementation {@link JsonPayloadSerializer} uses JSON encoding, but alternative
 * formats (binary, protobuf, etc.) can be implemented as needed.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface is typically used internally by the ArmoniK client during task submission
 * to create the payload blob that accompanies each submitted task.
 *
 * @see JsonPayloadSerializer
 * @see fr.aneo.armonik.client.blob.BlobDefinition

   * representation of the manifest that will be uploaded as the task's payload blob.
   *
   * <p>
   * The payload manifest serves as a reference map that the ArmoniK runtime uses to locate
   * and bind input/output blobs to the executing task. Both input and output mappings are
   * included even though outputs don't exist yet, as they represent the expected results
   * the task should produce.
